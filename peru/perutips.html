	   <h3> When travelling anywhere in South America it is essential to make sure you have the right vaccinations before you go. 
	   Unlike neighbouring countries, Peru's altitude makes it one of the 
	   safer zones on the continent but there are still some recommended boosters:</h3>
	   <p>Courses or boosters usually advised:</p>
			<ul class="tips-list">
			<li>Hepatitis A; </li>
			<li>Tetanus; </li>
			<li>Typhoid. </li>
			</ul>
<p>Other vaccines to consider: </p>

			<ol class="tips-list">
			<li>Diphtheria; </li>
			<li>Rabies; </li>
			<li>Yellow Fever.</li>
			</ol>
			

			<h3>Most of the tourist hotspots in Peru are totally safe and you will find locals very helpful and pleasant. 
			When in the cities, like any others you might visit make sure to be vigilant and stick to Miraflores and Barranco districts
			if you want to feel totally at ease when in Lima.</h3>

	   <h2 id="around">Getting Around</h2>
	   <h3>Travelling around Peru is very easy and there are plenty of options for every travellers budget.</h3>
	   <h4>Travelling by Plane: </h4>
	   <p>Domestic flights are the easy option and won't break the bank.
	   Considering it can be 21 hours quicker to fly from Lima to Cusco than the bus you may think it is worth those
		sacrificing some of the budget. However, while flying across Peru will save you precious hours you should also remember 
		that without a gradual ascent into the mountains you may find that altitude sickness takes its toll.
	   </p>
	   <p>Flights from Lima to Cusco take around 1hr 15mins and the following airlines operate out of Jorge Chavez:</p>

			<ul class="tips-list">
			<li>Latam; </li>
			<li>Star Peru; </li>
			<li>LCPeru; </li>
			<li>Peruvian Airlines. </li>
			</ul>lll
			
		 <h4>Travelling by Bus: </h4>
			<p>There will be plenty of places on your travel list that will not be accessible by plane which will lead 
			you to a lively bus station. </p>
			<p>Overnight buses are reccommended to travel long distance are they are often more 
			luxurious than there daytime counterparts. These days you will be treated to onboard food, blankets and movies which make
			 for a comfy ride, though the winding roads won't help you sleep!</p>
			 <p>The following companies offer the best facilities and smoothest ride, you can book at the station and make sure to ask around to get the best price: </p>

			<ul class="tips-list">
			<li>Cruz del Sur; </li>
			<li>Moviltours; </li>
			<li>Oltursa; </li>
			<li>Inka Express. </li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h4>Tip! In each bus station you will find a tax stamp booth, make sure to pay your tax here (usually 1Sol) before heading to your bus or you will be turned away.</h4>
			
			 <h4>Taxis: </h4>
			 <p>Getting around the towns and cities by taxi is by far the easiest option and you can expect to pay 
				4 - 5 Sol to get just about anywhere. You will hear them beeping their horns pretty much everywhere you go,
			  just stick out your thumb and you will flag a car in seconds. Getting around by car is a little frightening at first 
			  but you will soon become accustomed to the hustle and bustle.</p>
			  
			  <h4>Tip! Learning just a little Spanish before your trip will get you a long way in Peru, especially when booking travel.
			  Why not give it a try with the free <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">DuoLingo App.</a></h4>
